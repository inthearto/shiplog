# PR Timeline (Phase 5)

<!-- routing: tier-1, plan -->
<!-- cross-cutting: references/model-routing.md (Step 0), references/signing.md, references/closure-and-review.md, references/labels.md, references/orchestrator-protocol.md -->

0. **Routing check.** Run the phase entry check from `references/model-routing.md`.

1. **Pre-PR checks.** Follow `references/pr-workflow.md`. External PR skills may still be used for validation help, but shiplog's internal PR workflow is authoritative for title, body, labels, and review gate behavior.

2. **Create PR (Full Mode).** Use the PR timeline template below. Create the PR with `shiplog/history` and `shiplog/issue-driven` already applied. Sign per `references/signing.md`.

3. **Quiet Mode.** Create a clean feature PR (no shiplog content). Add a final summary comment to the `--log` PR using the quiet-mode template below. Sign per `references/signing.md`.

4. **Review gate.** Every PR requires cross-model review before merge. Use the execution ladder in `references/closure-and-review.md`: bounded reviewer lane if available, then external session delegation, then a contract-only review handoff. Local parallel tool fan-out does not count as an independent reviewer identity.

5. **Link and store.** PR body includes `Closes #<issue>` when the PR fully resolves the issue. For partial delivery, use `Addresses #<issue> (completes T1, T2, ...)` - see the partial-delivery template below and `references/closure-and-review.md` Section 1. Store key learning in knowledge graph.

6. **Closure verification (optional).** When evidence-to-issue mapping is non-obvious, optionally dispatch a verifier lane using the same orchestration ladder described in `references/closure-and-review.md` and `references/orchestrator-protocol.md`.

The PR body is large enough that `--body-file` should be the preferred portable path.
After every signed review comment and every post-review code push, refresh this review snapshot in place per `references/closure-and-review.md` and `references/signing.md`.

If review or cleanup work is dispatched in parallel, post the fan-out dispatch and collection artifacts from `references/orchestrator-protocol.md` instead of leaving that orchestration implicit in chat-only context.

## Partial-Delivery PR Variant

When a PR ships some tasks but the issue has remaining work:

```markdown
<!-- shiplog:
kind: history
issue: <ISSUE_NUMBER>
branch: issue/<ISSUE_NUMBER>-<slug>
status: in-progress
updated_at: <ISO_TIMESTAMP>
review_status: awaiting-review
-->

## Summary

[2-3 sentences: what this PR ships and why it is a partial delivery]

Addresses #<ISSUE_NUMBER> (completes T1, T2, T3)

## Review Status

- **Current state:** awaiting review
- **Last reviewed by:** none yet
- **Last reviewed at:** n/a
- **Reviewed commit:** n/a
- **Source artifact:** none yet
- **Needs re-review since:** no

## Completed Tasks

- [x] **T1:** [title] - [1-sentence summary of what shipped]
- [x] **T2:** [title] - [1-sentence summary]

## Remaining Tasks

- [ ] **T4:** [title] - [why deferred: blocked on X / next phase / needs design]
- [ ] **T5:** [title] - [why deferred]

## Blocked On

- [External dependency with link, or "No external blockers - remaining tasks deferred by choice"]

## Journey Timeline
